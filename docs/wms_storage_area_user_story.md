# Storage Area Management (wms_storage_area) User Story

## User Story
As a warehouse planner, I want to define logical storage areas (high rack, floor stack, cold storage, hazmat) so that I can optimize warehouse layout and storage strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can define and maintain storage area configurations with different area types (high_rack, floor_stack, cold_storage, hazmat, etc.)
- System can assign locations to specific storage areas based on physical characteristics
- System enforces area-specific storage rules and restrictions automatically
- System provides area utilization reports and capacity tracking
- Area-specific storage requirements are enforced for product placement
- System supports area-based picking and replenishment strategies
- Storage area capacity limits can be set and monitored in real-time
- Area performance metrics are tracked for optimization purposes

## Business Value
This feature will optimize warehouse space utilization by matching products with appropriate storage areas, improve operational efficiency through area-based strategies, provide clear visibility into capacity utilization, and support specialized storage requirements for different product types.
