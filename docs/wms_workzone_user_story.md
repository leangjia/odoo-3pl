## User Story
As a warehouse manager, I want to define and manage physical work zones (receiving, picking, packing, shipping) so that I can organize operations efficiently and assign staff to specific areas.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can define and maintain work zone configurations with different zone types (receiving, picking, packing, shipping, storage)
- System can assign locations to specific work zones based on warehouse layout
- System can assign users to work zones based on roles and responsibilities
- System provides work zone performance reports and analytics
- Zone-based data visibility is enforced for security and organization
- Work zone assignments take effect immediately for access control
- Zone performance metrics are tracked separately for optimization

## Business Value
This feature will improve warehouse organization by clearly defining operational areas, enable better staff assignment and management, provide zone-specific performance insights for optimization, and maintain proper data security through zone-based access controls.
